\title{Vitamin D dataset for cosinor modeling examples.}
\format{
A \code{data.frame} with 3 variables: \code{vit_d}, \code{time}, and
\code{X}.
}
\usage{
vitamind
}
\description{
Simulated data set to illustrate the cosinor model. The \code{vit_d} column
contains the blood vitamin D levels which vary over time (\code{time}).
The rhythm of the vitamind D fluctuations follows a cosine function and can
be modeled with a cosinor model. The \code{X} column is a binary covariate
representing two groups of patients and is associated with the
characteristics of the rhythm. The rhythm has a period of about 12 hours.
